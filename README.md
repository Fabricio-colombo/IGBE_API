# Dissertation on the Analysis of Endangered Species in Brazil

## Introduction
This dissertation aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of endangered species in Brazil. The work was carried out as part of my study in Software Engineering and focused on the use of statistical data from the IBGE API.

## Methodology
Data Collection
To gather the necessary data, I used the IBGE API to obtain information about endangered species in Brazil. The query was based on statistical aggregates, variables, and specific classifications.

### The API query URL was as follows:
https://servicodados.ibge.gov.br/api/v3/agregados/9625/periodos/2014|2022/variaveis/10484?localidades=N1[all]&classificacao=454[all]|919[48243]|971[48741,59952,59953,59954,59955,59956,59957,59958]|12920[119363,119343,119344,119345,119346]

## Data Analysis
After collecting the data, I performed a statistical analysis to identify trends and variations in endangered species over time. This included comparing the numbers from 2014 and 2022.

# Results
The main results of the analysis were as follows:

In 2014, there were a total of 16,313 endangered species in Brazil.
In 2022, this number increased to 21,456 species.
The percentage increase between 2014 and 2022 was approximately 31.24%.
Conclusion
This dissertation provided a comprehensive analysis of endangered species in Brazil based on data from the IBGE API. The results highlight a significant increase in the number of endangered species over the years. This underscores the importance of biodiversity conservation in the country and emphasizes the need for effective actions to protect these species.
